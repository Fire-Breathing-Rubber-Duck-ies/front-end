# Bucket List Browser

Technologies used in this project include HTML, SASS, Javascript, jQuery, Handlebars, and the DOM.

This client connects to our heroku database where a user can create a check list of things they would like to achieve before they quack using Mongodb.

## Planning

Our plan for coding this team project was to coordinate with each other to develop and implement features. Firstly, deploy our backend mongodb for login functionality including sign in, sign up, change password and sign out. Secondly, add a new schema to the database for users to add list items. Finally, to implement form handlers for user submissions and CRUD requests.

### Unsolved Issues:

We're still working out the details for a maps api to save suggested locations where users can complete their list items.

# User stories:

Version 1: \
As a user, I want to be able to log in to my account \
As a user, I want to be able to see a list of things I want to do before I kick the bucket. \
As a user, I want to be able to add items to my list \
As a user, I want to be able to edit items \
As a user, I need to be able to remove items, or say that I did the item

Version 2: \
As a user, I want to have many lists, composed of many different items \
As a user, I want to see on a map where all my activities are
